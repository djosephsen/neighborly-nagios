#Neighborly Nagios

This [LISA-2015 mini tutorial session]() is an introductory course on Nagios
that emphasizes cooperation with other tools.  Nagios never claimed to be the
center of the monitoringosphere, but it's a great centralized poller, and can
certainly be made to play nice with other monitoring tools that focus on other
things.
